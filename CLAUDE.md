# CLAUDE.md

This repository is Pawcast, a Tauri 2 desktop application (Vite + React 18 + TypeScript) for A-B looping, shadowing recording, transcripts, and AI-assisted language-learning workflows.

## Scope

- Applies to the entire repository unless a deeper `CLAUDE.md` overrides it.
- Prefer small, focused changes that preserve existing UX patterns and state behavior.

## Workflow

- Read the relevant files before editing.
- Prefer `rg`/`rg --files` for search.
- Make minimal, targeted edits.
- Do not revert user changes you did not make.
- Avoid unrelated refactors unless they are required to complete the task safely.

## Stack

- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Framer Motion
- State: Zustand
- Routing: React Router
- i18n: `src/i18n` with locale JSON files in `src/i18n/locales`

## Platform Architecture

This project ships desktop-only on Tauri; the Vite dev server can still run it
in a plain browser for development. A strict layered architecture is
enforced — read **[docs/platform-architecture.md](docs/platform-architecture.md)**
before adding any feature that touches platform-specific behavior.

Key rules (full details in the doc):
- Tauri imports and runtime detection are only allowed under `src/platform/desktop/` and `src/platform/runtime.ts`.
- Shared code consumes the typed `DesktopAPI`; it must not invoke Rust commands directly.
- Desktop-specific components live in `src/components/desktop/`, never in shared directories (`src/components/web/` holds only the browser dev-fallback shell).
- Pages always use `<AppLayout>` (the facade) — never `DesktopAppLayout` or `WebAppLayout` directly.

## Project Conventions

- Preserve the current component structure under `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/hooks`, `src/stores`, and `src/utils`.
- When changing user-facing copy, update translations in:
  - `src/i18n/locales/en.json`
  - `src/i18n/locales/ja.json`
  - `src/i18n/locales/zh.json`
- Reuse existing UI primitives from `src/components/ui` before creating new ones.
- Follow the established Zustand store patterns instead of introducing new global state approaches.
- Keep browser-only behavior compatible with Vite client execution.
- Treat audio, media, transcript, and recording flows as sensitive areas that need careful regression avoidance.

## Validation

- Run targeted validation after changes when possible.
- Common commands:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run check:tauri`

## Response Expectations

- Summarize what changed, note any risks, and mention validation performed.
- If checks were not run, say so explicitly.

## Compact Instructions

When compressing, preserve in priority order:

1. Architecture decisions (NEVER summarize)
2. Modified files and their key changes
3. Current verification status (pass/fail)
4. Open TODOs and rollback notes
5. Tool outputs (can delete, keep pass/fail only)
